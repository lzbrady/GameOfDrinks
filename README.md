# Game of Drinks
A Drinking Game for the ages.

Want to spice up your pregames? Chill night of drinking needs a little extra boost?
You came to the right place.

How to Play:

1) Start by having one person in your group type in their name, then hit 'Play Game'.
2) Everybody else should type in their name, then the group id and hit 'Join Game'.
      *The group id is seen on the loading screen of anyone in the lobby
3) Once everyone is in the lobby, some one hits 'Start Game' to begin.

Full Game Mode:
In full game mode you will be randomly cycled through each of the mini games, acquiring points an drinks as your progress. At the end of the round there will be one last bonus round, worth double the points, to ultimately decide the winner (or loser, depending on how you look at it). After the last round ends, there will be the Ceremony of Drinks. This is when scores are calculated, and drinks are distributed. May the best man win.

Mini Game Mode:
In mini game mode, you can choose to play certain mini games at your leisure. You get to choose which games you play and keep your own pace, but there will be no points kept track of, only drink distributions at the end of each round.

Thanks for playing!

Drink responsibly
